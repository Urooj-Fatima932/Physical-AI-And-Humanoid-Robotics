## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T010 from `tasks.md` to write the "Colcon Build System" chapter for the ROS 2 module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ros2/05-build-system-colcon.md` was successfully created with content explaining the Colcon build system, workspaces, and the build lifecycle. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Colcon build system chapter for the ROS 2 module is complete. This chapter is essential for students to understand how to build and manage their own ROS 2 packages.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ros2/05-build-system-colcon.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers the key aspects of Colcon as required by the spec.
