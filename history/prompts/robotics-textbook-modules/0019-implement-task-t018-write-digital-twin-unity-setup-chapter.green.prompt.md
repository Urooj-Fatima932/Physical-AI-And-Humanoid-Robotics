## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T018 from `tasks.md` to write the "Unity Setup" chapter for the Digital Twin module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/04-unity-setup.md` was successfully created with basic instructions for setting up a Unity project for robotics simulation. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Unity setup chapter for the Digital Twin module is complete, introducing students to an alternative simulation platform.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/04-unity-setup.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers the basic setup and concepts for Unity robotics simulation, aligning with the spec.
