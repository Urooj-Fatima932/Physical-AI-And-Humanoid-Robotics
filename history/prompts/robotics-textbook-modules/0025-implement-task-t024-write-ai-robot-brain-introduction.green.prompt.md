## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T024 from `tasks.md` to write the introduction for the AI-Robot Brain module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ai-robot-brain/01-introduction.md` was successfully created with introductory content, and the task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The introduction chapter for the AI-Robot Brain module is complete, setting the stage for understanding the role of AI in robotics and the NVIDIA Isaac platform.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ai-robot-brain/01-introduction.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The generated content aligns with the goals of the module as defined in the spec, covering the fundamental role of AI and introducing the Isaac platform.
