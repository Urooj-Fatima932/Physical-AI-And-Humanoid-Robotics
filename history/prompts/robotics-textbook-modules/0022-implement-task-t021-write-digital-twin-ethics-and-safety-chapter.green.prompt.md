## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T021 from `tasks.md` to write the "Ethics and Safety" chapter for the Digital Twin module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/07-ethics-and-safety.md` was successfully created with content discussing ethical and safety considerations in digital twin robotics. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The ethics and safety chapter for the Digital Twin module is complete. This chapter ensures the module addresses the important ethical implications of digital twins as required by the constitution.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/07-ethics-and-safety.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content fulfills the constitutional mandate for ethics and safety in each module, specifically addressing the reality gap and accountability.
