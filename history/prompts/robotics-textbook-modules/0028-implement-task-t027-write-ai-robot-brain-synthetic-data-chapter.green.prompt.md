## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T027 from `tasks.md` to write the "Synthetic Data" chapter for the AI-Robot Brain module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ai-robot-brain/04-synthetic-data.md` was successfully created with content explaining what synthetic data is, its importance, and how Isaac Sim can be used for its generation. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The synthetic data chapter for the AI-Robot Brain module is complete, providing students with knowledge about a critical aspect of AI training in robotics.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ai-robot-brain/04-synthetic-data.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers key aspects of synthetic data generation as required by the spec.
