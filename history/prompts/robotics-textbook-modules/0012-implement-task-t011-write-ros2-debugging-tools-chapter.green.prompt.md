## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T011 from `tasks.md` to write the "Debugging Tools" chapter for the ROS 2 module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ros2/06-debugging-tools.md` was successfully created with content explaining various ROS 2 debugging tools. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The debugging tools chapter for the ROS 2 module is complete. This chapter provides students with the essential knowledge to debug their own ROS 2 applications.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ros2/06-debugging-tools.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers the key debugging tools as required by the spec.
