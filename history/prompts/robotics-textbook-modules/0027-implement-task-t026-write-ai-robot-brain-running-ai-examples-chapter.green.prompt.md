## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T026 from `tasks.md` to write the "Running AI Examples" chapter for the AI-Robot Brain module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ai-robot-brain/03-running-ai-examples.md` was successfully created with content demonstrating how to load a sample robot in Isaac Sim, execute a basic AI-driven behavior, and observe its autonomous behavior. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The "Running AI Examples" chapter for the AI-Robot Brain module is complete, providing students with practical experience in applying AI within Isaac Sim.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ai-robot-brain/03-running-ai-examples.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content fulfills the requirement of demonstrating basic AI examples and observing autonomous behavior in Isaac Sim.
