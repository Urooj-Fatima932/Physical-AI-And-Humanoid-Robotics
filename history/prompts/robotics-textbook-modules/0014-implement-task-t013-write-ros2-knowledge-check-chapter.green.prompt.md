## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T013 from `tasks.md` to write the "Knowledge Check" chapter for the ROS 2 module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ros2/08-knowledge-check.md` was successfully created with multiple-choice questions and a practical exercise. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The knowledge check chapter for the ROS 2 module is complete. This completes all content tasks for Module 1, ensuring students can assess their understanding.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ros2/08-knowledge-check.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task, starting Module 2)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content for the knowledge check aligns with the learning objectives and success criteria defined in the spec.
