## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T036 from `tasks.md` to write the "Limitations and Future" chapter for the VLA module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/vla/05-limitations-and-future.md` was successfully created with content discussing current challenges, limitations, and future research directions for VLA models. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The "Limitations and Future" chapter for the VLA module is complete, providing students with a forward-looking perspective on the field and its challenges.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/vla/05-limitations-and-future.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers key limitations and future directions as required by the spec's FR-004 and edge cases.
