## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T034 from `tasks.md` to write the "VLA Models" chapter for the VLA module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/vla/03-vla-models.md` was successfully created with content showcasing prominent VLA models and their applications. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The VLA models chapter for the VLA module is complete, providing students with exposure to existing VLA models and their applications.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files:
