## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T017 from `tasks.md` to write the "Gazebo Simulation" chapter for the Digital Twin module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/03-gazebo-simulation.md` was successfully created with content demonstrating how to launch a Gazebo world, load a robot model, and interact with it using ROS 2. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Gazebo simulation chapter for the Digital Twin module is complete, providing students with practical experience in running robot simulations.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/03-gazebo-simulation.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content includes step-by-step instructions and code examples, aligning with the educational rigor constitution.
