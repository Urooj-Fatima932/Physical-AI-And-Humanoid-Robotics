## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T038 from `tasks.md` to write the "Knowledge Check" chapter for the VLA module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/vla/07-knowledge-check.md` was successfully created with multiple-choice questions and a scenario-based task. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The knowledge check chapter for the VLA module is complete. This completes all content tasks for Module 4, ensuring students can assess their understanding. All content creation for the four modules is now complete.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/vla/07-knowledge-check.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task, starting Phase N: Polish)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content for the knowledge check aligns with the learning objectives and success criteria defined in the spec, including practical and scenario-based questions.
