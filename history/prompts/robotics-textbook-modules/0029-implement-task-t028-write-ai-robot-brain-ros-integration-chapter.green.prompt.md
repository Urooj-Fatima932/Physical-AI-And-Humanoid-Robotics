## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T028 from `tasks.md` to write the "ROS Integration" chapter for the AI-Robot Brain module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ai-robot-brain/05-ros-integration.md` was successfully created with content explaining how Isaac Sim can be integrated with ROS 2 for communication and control. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The ROS integration chapter for the AI-Robot Brain module is complete, addressing a key edge case and providing valuable information for students.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ai-robot-brain/05-ros-integration.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers the Isaac ROS Bridge and common integration workflows and challenges, aligning with the spec.
