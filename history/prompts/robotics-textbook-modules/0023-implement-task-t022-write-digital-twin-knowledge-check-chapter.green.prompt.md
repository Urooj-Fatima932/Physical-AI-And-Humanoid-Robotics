## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T022 from `tasks.md` to write the "Knowledge Check" chapter for the Digital Twin module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/08-knowledge-check.md` was successfully created with multiple-choice questions and practical exercises. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The knowledge check chapter for the Digital Twin module is complete. This completes all content tasks for Module 2, ensuring students can assess their understanding.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/08-knowledge-check.md (created)
