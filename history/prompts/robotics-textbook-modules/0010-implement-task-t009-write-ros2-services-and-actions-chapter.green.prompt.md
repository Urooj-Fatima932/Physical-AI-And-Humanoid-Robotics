## Prompt

/sp.implement Execute the next task in the approved task list.and inform me after completing each task and wait for next instructions

## Response snapshot

Executed task T009 from `tasks.md` to write the "Services and Actions" chapter for the ROS 2 module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ros2/04-services-actions.md` was successfully created with content explaining services and actions with code examples. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The services and actions chapter for the ROS 2 module is complete. This chapter explains more advanced communication patterns in ROS 2.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/ros2/04-services-actions.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content provides a good overview of services and actions, fulfilling the requirements of the spec.
