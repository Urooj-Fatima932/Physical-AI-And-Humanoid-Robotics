## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T019 from `tasks.md` to write the "Unity Simulation" chapter for the Digital Twin module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/05-unity-simulation.md` was successfully created with content demonstrating how to set up a simple simulation in Unity and integrate it with ROS 2. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Unity simulation chapter for the Digital Twin module is complete, providing students with practical experience in simulating robots with Unity and connecting them to ROS 2.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/05-unity-simulation.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers basic simulation setup and ROS 2 integration, fulfilling the spec requirements for Unity.
