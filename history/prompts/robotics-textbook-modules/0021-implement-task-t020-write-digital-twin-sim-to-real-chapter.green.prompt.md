## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T020 from `tasks.md` to write the "Sim-to-Real" chapter for the Digital Twin module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/06-sim-to-real.md` was successfully created with content explaining the reality gap and strategies for Sim-to-Real transfer. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Sim-to-Real chapter for the Digital Twin module is complete, providing students with critical insights into bridging the gap between simulation and physical robots.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/06-sim-to-real.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers an important advanced topic in robotics simulation, as required by the spec's edge cases.
