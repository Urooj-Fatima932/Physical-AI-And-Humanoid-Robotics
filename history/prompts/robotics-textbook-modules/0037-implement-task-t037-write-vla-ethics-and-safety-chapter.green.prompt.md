## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T037 from `tasks.md` to write the "Ethics and Safety" chapter for the VLA module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/vla/06-ethics-and-safety.md` was successfully created with content discussing ethical and safety implications of VLA robots. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The ethics and safety chapter for the VLA module is complete. This chapter ensures the module addresses the important ethical implications of VLA in robotics as required by the constitution.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/vla/06-ethics-and-safety.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers key ethical considerations including autonomy, safety, accountability, and potential misuse of VLA robots.
