## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T016 from `tasks.md` to write the "Gazebo Setup" chapter for the Digital Twin module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/02-gazebo-setup.md` was successfully created with step-by-step instructions for installing Gazebo and integrating it with ROS 2. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Gazebo setup chapter for the Digital Twin module is complete, providing students with the necessary steps to configure their Gazebo environment.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/02-gazebo-setup.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
