## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T033 from `tasks.md` to write the "VLA Architecture" chapter for the VLA module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/vla/02-vla-architecture.md` was successfully created with content detailing the architectural components of VLA systems, including a Mermaid.js diagram. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The VLA architecture chapter for the VLA module is complete, providing students with a clear understanding of how VLA systems are structured.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/vla/02-vla-architecture.md (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The content covers the key components and their interplay, aligning with the spec requirements.
