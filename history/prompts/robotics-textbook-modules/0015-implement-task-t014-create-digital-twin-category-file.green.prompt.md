## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T014 from `tasks.md` to create the category file for the Digital Twin module. The file `classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/_category_.json` was successfully created with default content, and the task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Docusaurus category for the Digital Twin module has been created, allowing it to be displayed correctly in the sidebar.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - classic/docs/robotics-textbook/digital-twin/_category_.json (created)
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: Creating the category file is a necessary step for Docusaurus to correctly structure the documentation sidebar.
