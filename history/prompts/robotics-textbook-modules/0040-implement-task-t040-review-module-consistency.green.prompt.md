## Prompt

/sp.implement okay now implement next tasks one by one and complete the project keep informing me about the progress

## Response snapshot

Executed task T040 from `tasks.md` to review all modules for consistency and adherence to the constitution. A manual review was performed to check Docusaurus formatting, heading levels, ISO terminology, and the presence of required sections (Learning Objectives, Knowledge Checks, Ethics/Safety, VLA Mandate). The modules appear consistent and adhere to the project constitution. The task was marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All modules have been reviewed for consistency and adherence to the constitution, ensuring a high quality of content.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - specs/main/tasks.md (updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (for next task)
- 🧠 Reflection: The review process confirmed that the content generation largely followed the established guidelines.
